# Silero VAD Configuration
# -----------------------------
# ML-based voice activity detection - PRIMARY speech detection method
# Energy-based VAD has been removed entirely to eliminate volume bias
#
# Uses the energy_threshold value from database (per campaign) as Silero speech probability threshold
# This is NOT an energy/volume threshold - it's ML confidence that audio contains speech
#
# Threshold interpretation (configured in database energy_threshold field):
# 0.0 - Accept almost all audio (Silero will filter only extreme noise)
# 0.25 - Very sensitive (catches whispers and quiet speech, minimal false positives)
# 0.3 - Sensitive (good for quiet speakers)
# 0.4 - Balanced for most use cases
# 0.5 - Conservative (recommended default)
# 0.6 - Strict (filters more aggressively)
# 0.7 - Very strict (only clear speech)
#
# Key benefits over energy-based VAD:
# - Detects quiet/whispered speech (low volume but clear speech patterns)
# - Filters loud noise (high volume but no speech patterns)
# - No volume bias - purely acoustic pattern recognition
#
# Implementation (CPU-optimized singleton):
# - Global singleton pattern (shared across all calls, zero per-call overhead)
# - Preloaded at bot_server startup from /root/sip-bot/models/silero_vad/
# - CPU inference: 0.11ms per chunk (negligible contention, thread-safe)
# - Memory: 2.2MB total (one-time), not per-call
# - Performance: Eliminates 1.4-6 seconds of redundant loading per call

# Continuous Background Noise Configuration
# -----------------------------
# Continuous background noise is automatically enabled when configured in the database.
# The system uses the existing e_campaigns table fields:
#
# Database Configuration (e_campaigns table):
#   - background_noise_volume: Controls volume for both continuous player and mixing (0.0 to 1.0)
#     * 0.0 = Disabled (no continuous background noise)
#     * 0.1-0.3 = Subtle ambient noise (recommended for most campaigns)
#     * 0.4-0.6 = Medium ambient noise
#     * 0.7-1.0 = Strong ambient noise
#   - noise_location: Path to background noise audio file (linked via e_noise table)
#
# Implementation:
#   - ContinuousBackgroundNoisePlayer: Dedicated PJSIP player for looping background noise
#   - Runs continuously throughout entire call (during bot speech AND listening periods)
#   - Independent of main audio playback system
#   - Graceful failure: If player fails, call continues normally
#   - Automatic cleanup on call end
#
# Benefits:
#   - Natural call ambience with no "dead air" during listening periods
#   - Professional audio quality throughout call
#   - Layered with existing bot speech mixing for consistent sound
#
# Memory Impact:
#   - ~2-3 MB per call (looped audio file + player instance)
#   - Temp files automatically cleaned up after call ends
#
# To disable continuous background noise for a campaign:
#   - Set background_noise_volume = 0 in e_campaigns table for that campaign
